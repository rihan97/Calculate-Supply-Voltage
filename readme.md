### ***The Supply Calculator program***

The Supply Calculator program was developed to calculate the Supply Voltage, once you input the values for the following; Resistor Value, Forward Voltage and the Rated current you would be able to calculate the supply voltage. The following is some test data you can use to test the program.

| Resistor Value | Forward Voltage of LED | Rated current | Program Result           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| 9              | 1.8                    | 20            | 181.8 supply voltage     |
| 5              | -4                     | 0.001         | -3.995 Supply voltage    |
| 3.3            | -4.5                   | 0             | -4.5 Supply voltage      |
| 5v             | 2v                     | 20.5mA        | 102.0 Supply voltage     |


Feel free to use your own test data to have a go at calculating the supply voltage.
